# kc_modpack
Kinetic Combat for minetest

## Primary Features
* ducking and defending
* high and low attacks
* a unique non-fantasy stat system with character building
* transient stats used to perform techniques
* mobs eventually should be programmed with all of the above
* transient stats can alternatively be used to create equipment enhancements (but not how you're thinking)

## Known Issues
* implement all of the above (this modpack doesn't do anything yet)
