## Primary Features
* Duck or defend.
* Attack high or low.
* Use a unique non-fantasy stat system with character building.
* Use transient stats used to perform techniques.
* Unify the interface (API) for the player entity and mobs:
  * Each mob should get all of the features above.
  * Unify of methods for determining damage including based on armor and environment.
* transient stats can alternatively be used to create equipment enhancements.

## Known Issues
* Implement all of the above (This modpack doesn't do anything yet.)
